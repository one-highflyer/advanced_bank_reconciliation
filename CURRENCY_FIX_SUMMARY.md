# Currency Fix Summary - Advanced Bank Reconciliation Tool

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Payment Entry Display Currency Issue

**Problem**: When reconciling a foreign currency bank account (e.g., USD) with a company base currency (e.g., LKR), the payment entry amounts were displayed in LKR instead of USD, making it difficult for users to match with USD bank transactions.

**Root Cause**: The `get_pe_matching_query` function was using `paid_amount` field which is always in the company's base currency, not the bank account's currency.

**Solution**: Simplified the logic significantly by using the correct amount fields that ERPNext already stores in the bank account's currency:
- For **Receive payments** (deposits): Use `received_amount` field directly (already in bank account currency)
- For **Pay payments** (withdrawals): Use `paid_amount` field directly (already in bank account currency)
- No complex exchange rate calculations needed - ERPNext stores the amounts correctly
- Adding tolerance for amount matching (0.01) to handle minor rounding differences

**Key Insight**: ERPNext Payment Entry already stores amounts in the correct currencies. We just needed to pick the right field based on payment type!

### 2. Cleared Balance Calculation Currency Issue

**Problem**: The `get_cleared_balance` function was calculating balances using base currency amounts instead of bank account currency amounts.

**Solution**: Updated the cleared balance query to:
- Use `received_amount` for Receive payments where bank account is `paid_to`
- Use `paid_amount` for Pay payments where bank account is `paid_from`
- Simplified logic matching the payment entry query

## Technical Changes Made

### File: `advance_bank_reconciliation_tool.py`

#### 1. Updated `get_pe_matching_query` function (lines 811-886)
- Simplified to use correct amount fields based on payment type
- For Receive payments: Use `received_amount` when `paid_to = bank_account`
- For Pay payments: Use `paid_amount` when `paid_from = bank_account`
- Added tolerance-based matching instead of exact matching
- Removed complex exchange rate calculations

#### 2. Updated `get_cleared_balance` function (lines 1193-1226)
- Simplified payment entries query to use same logic as matching query
- Use `received_amount` for Receive payments, `paid_amount` for Pay payments
- Ensured consistency with the matching query logic

#### 3. Updated `validate_bank_transactions` function (lines 1280-1350)
- Fixed the query to use correct payment amount based on payment type
- For Receive payments: Use `received_amount` when `paid_to = bank_account`
- For Pay payments: Use `paid_amount` when `paid_from = bank_account`
- Updated validation logic to compare `allocated_amount` with correct `payment_amount`

#### 4. Journal Entry Query (already correct)
- The `get_je_matching_query` already uses `debit_in_account_currency` and `credit_in_account_currency`
- No changes needed as Journal Entries store account currency amounts directly

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Currency Display**: Payment entries now show amounts in the bank account's currency, making reconciliation easier
2. **Consistent Matching**: Bank transactions and payment entries are now compared in the same currency
3. **Improved User Experience**: Users working with foreign currency bank accounts can easily match transactions
4. **Correct Balance Calculations**: Cleared balances are now calculated in the correct currency

## Test Scenarios

To verify the fixes work correctly, test with:
1. A USD bank account in a company with LKR base currency
2. Payment entries made in USD that should match USD bank transactions
3. Cleared balance calculations for foreign currency accounts
4. Bank transaction validation for foreign currency payment entries
5. Mixed currency scenarios with both local and foreign currency transactions

## Notes

- **Simplified Approach**: No exchange rate calculations needed - ERPNext already stores amounts in the correct currencies
- The solution maintains backward compatibility with single-currency setups
- Tolerance-based matching (0.01) helps handle minor rounding differences in currency conversions
- **Key Insight**: Payment Entry fields already contain the correct currency amounts:
  - `received_amount`: Amount received in the bank account's currency (for Receive payments)
  - `paid_amount`: Amount paid from the bank account's currency (for Pay payments)

## Field Usage Logic

- **For Receive payments**: Use `received_amount` when `payment_type = 'Receive'` AND `paid_to = bank_account`
- **For Pay payments**: Use `paid_amount` when `payment_type = 'Pay'` AND `paid_from = bank_account`
- **Currency matching**: Payment entry amounts are now displayed in the same currency as bank transactions
