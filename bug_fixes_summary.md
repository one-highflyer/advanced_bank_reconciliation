# Bug Fixes Summary - Bank Statement Importer

## Overview
Fixed two JavaScript runtime errors in the Bank Statement Importer DocType caused by attempts to manipulate an undefined field `bank_account_select`.

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Undefined Field Manipulation Causes Error
**Location**: `advanced_bank_reconciliation/advanced_bank_reconciliation/doctype/bank_statement_importer/bank_statement_importer.js:91`

**Issue**: The code was attempting to set options for a non-existent field `bank_account_select`.

**Fix**: Removed the line that tries to set properties for the undefined field:
```javascript
// REMOVED: frm.set_df_property("bank_account_select", "options", options);
```

### Bug 2: Undefined Field Refresh Causes JS Error  
**Location**: `advanced_bank_reconciliation/advanced_bank_reconciliation/doctype/bank_statement_importer/bank_statement_importer.js:152`

**Issue**: The code was attempting to refresh the non-existent field `bank_account_select`.

**Fix**: Removed the line that tries to refresh the undefined field:
```javascript
// REMOVED: frm.refresh_field("bank_account_select");
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The `bank_account_select` field was referenced in the JavaScript code but was never defined in the DocType schema (`bank_statement_importer.json`). The defined select fields in the schema are:
- `date_select`
- `deposit_select` 
- `withdrawal_select`
- `amount_select`
- `description_select`
- `reference_number_select`

## Verification
- ✅ Confirmed no remaining references to `bank_account_select` in the codebase
- ✅ All other field operations remain intact and functional
- ✅ No impact on existing functionality for the properly defined fields

## Files Modified
1. `advanced_bank_reconciliation/advanced_bank_reconciliation/doctype/bank_statement_importer/bank_statement_importer.js`

The fixes ensure that the JavaScript code only operates on fields that actually exist in the DocType schema, eliminating the runtime errors that were occurring when the form tried to manipulate the undefined `bank_account_select` field.
