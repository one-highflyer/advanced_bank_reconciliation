# Unpaid Invoice Reconciliation Feature - Implementation Report

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the "Unpaid Sales Invoice" and "Unpaid Purchase Invoice" reconciliation feature for the Advanced Bank Reconciliation Tool. This feature allows users to directly reconcile bank transactions against unpaid invoices by automatically creating payment entries during the reconciliation process.

## Problem Statement

The existing bank reconciliation tool supported matching against:
- Payment Entry
- Journal Entry
- Sales Invoice (paid)
- Purchase Invoice (paid)

However, it did not support reconciling against unpaid invoices. When an invoice was paid directly to the bank account but no payment entry was created in the system, users had to manually create payment entries before they could reconcile the bank transaction. This was particularly cumbersome for large volumes of transactions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New Query Functions Added

**File**: `advanced_bank_reconciliation/advanced_bank_reconciliation/doctype/advance_bank_reconciliation_tool/advance_bank_reconciliation_tool.py`

1. **`get_unpaid_si_matching_query(exact_match)`**: 
   - Fetches unpaid Sales Invoices that match the bank transaction
   - Filters by `outstanding_amount > 0` and status not in ('Paid', 'Cancelled', 'Credit Note Issued')

2. **`get_unpaid_pi_matching_query(exact_match)`**:
   - Fetches unpaid Purchase Invoices that match the bank transaction  
   - Filters by `outstanding_amount > 0` and status not in ('Paid', 'Cancelled', 'Debit Note Issued')

3. **`create_payment_entries_for_invoices(bank_transaction_name, invoices)`**:
   - Creates payment entries for selected unpaid invoices
   - Automatically reconciles the created payment entries with the bank transaction
   - Returns the reconciliation result

4. **`create_payment_entry_for_invoice(invoice_doc, bank_transaction, allocated_amount, payment_type, party_type, party)`**:
   - Creates a single payment entry for an unpaid invoice
   - Sets the correct bank account, amounts, and reference details
   - Links the payment to the invoice and submits it

5. **`get_doctypes_for_bank_reconciliation()`**:
   - Custom function that returns all available document types including the new unpaid invoice types
   - Replaces the ERPNext standard function call

#### Modified Functions

1. **`get_matching_queries()`**: Updated to include calls to the new unpaid invoice query functions
2. **Query integration**: Added logic to handle "unpaid_sales_invoice" and "unpaid_purchase_invoice" document types

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Dialog Manager Updates

**File**: `advanced_bank_reconciliation/public/js/advance_bank_reconciliation_tool/dialog_manager.js`

1. **Method Call Update**: Changed from ERPNext's `get_doctypes_for_bank_reconciliation` to our custom implementation
2. **Enhanced Match Function**: Modified the `match()` method to detect when unpaid invoices are selected and handle them differently:
   - If unpaid invoices are selected: Creates payment entries first, then reconciles
   - If regular vouchers are selected: Uses the standard reconciliation process

### 3. User Experience Flow

1. **Select Bank Transaction**: User selects an unreconciled bank transaction
2. **Open Reconciliation Dialog**: Click "Match Against Voucher" action
3. **Choose Document Types**: User can now select "Unpaid Sales Invoice" or "Unpaid Purchase Invoice" along with other types
4. **Filter and Search**: System shows matching unpaid invoices based on amount, party, etc.
5. **Select Invoices**: User selects one or more unpaid invoices to reconcile against
6. **Auto-Create Payment Entries**: System automatically:
   - Creates payment entries for each selected invoice
   - Links payment entries to the respective invoices
   - Sets the correct amounts and bank account details
   - Reconciles the payment entries with the bank transaction
7. **Completion**: User receives confirmation that payment entries were created and bank transaction was matched

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries

The unpaid invoice queries use the following key criteria:

**For Sales Invoices**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM `tabSales Invoice` 
WHERE docstatus = 1 
AND status NOT IN ('Paid', 'Cancelled', 'Credit Note Issued')
AND outstanding_amount > 0
```

**For Purchase Invoices**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM `tabPurchase Invoice` 
WHERE docstatus = 1 
AND status NOT IN ('Paid', 'Cancelled', 'Debit Note Issued') 
AND outstanding_amount > 0
```

### Payment Entry Creation Logic

1. **Determine Payment Type**: 
   - Sales Invoice → "Receive" payment
   - Purchase Invoice → "Pay" payment

2. **Set Bank Account**:
   - For "Receive": Set `paid_to` to bank GL account
   - For "Pay": Set `paid_from` to bank GL account

3. **Amount Allocation**:
   - Uses the selected allocation amount (can be partial payment)
   - Updates the invoice reference table accordingly

4. **Reference Details**:
   - Copies reference number and date from bank transaction
   - Sets posting date to bank transaction date

### Error Handling

- Validates that invoices are selected before processing
- Ensures allocated amounts are greater than zero
- Validates payment entry before submission
- Provides meaningful error messages to users

## Benefits

1. **User Efficiency**: Eliminates the need to manually create payment entries before reconciliation
2. **Reduced Errors**: Automatic creation ensures consistent data entry
3. **Batch Processing**: Can handle multiple unpaid invoices in a single reconciliation action
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintains proper links between bank transactions, payment entries, and invoices
5. **Flexibility**: Supports partial payments against invoices

## Files Modified

1. `advanced_bank_reconciliation/advanced_bank_reconciliation/doctype/advance_bank_reconciliation_tool/advance_bank_reconciliation_tool.py`
   - Added new query functions
   - Added payment entry creation functions
   - Modified matching query logic

2. `advanced_bank_reconciliation/public/js/advance_bank_reconciliation_tool/dialog_manager.js`
   - Updated method calls to use custom doctype function
   - Enhanced match function to handle unpaid invoices

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Test with various unpaid invoice scenarios
   - Verify payment entries are created with correct details
   - Confirm reconciliation works for both sales and purchase invoices
   - Test partial payment scenarios

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify integration with existing ERPNext payment entry workflow
   - Test with multi-currency scenarios
   - Validate GL entries and accounting impact

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with large volumes of unpaid invoices
   - Verify query performance with extensive data

4. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Validate user workflow and experience
   - Confirm error messages are clear and helpful
   - Test various user permission scenarios

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Document Types**: Could be extended to support other unpaid documents like Expense Claims
2. **Smart Matching**: Implement AI/ML-based matching suggestions
3. **Bulk Operations**: Add support for bulk reconciliation of multiple bank transactions
4. **Integration**: Deeper integration with ERPNext's Payment Reconciliation tool

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses the user request for supporting unpaid invoice reconciliation. It maintains compatibility with existing functionality while adding powerful new capabilities that significantly improve the user experience for bank reconciliation workflows.

The solution is robust, follows ERPNext/Frappe development patterns, and provides a seamless experience for users dealing with high volumes of bank transactions and unpaid invoices.
